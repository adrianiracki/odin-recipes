<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Cheesecake has always been my favorite type of cake. It can be prepared in many 
    different ways and it's always delicious. This one requires a bit more work but it's definitely 
    worth it.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
    <li>½ vanilla bean</li>
    <li>1½ cup unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 egg yolk</li>
    <li>5 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
    <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
    <li>½ vanilla bean</li>
    <li>5 eggs</li>
    <li>2 egg yolks</li>
    <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon lemon peel, and 
        1 teaspoon orange peel. Split a 1-inch piece of vanilla bean; scrape seeds into flour 
        mixture. Cut in butter until mixture resembles course crumbs. Add 1 egg yolk; stir until 
        all flour is moistened. Gather dough into ball, wrap in wax paper, and refrigerate for 
        1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Lightly butter a 9 inch springform pan. Roll dough on lightly floured surface to 1/8 inch 
        thick; trim to a 10 inch circle. Reserve pastry trimmings. Press pastry circle into bottom 
        and 1/2 inch up sides of a 9 inch buttered springform pan. Refrigerate 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake crust for 20 minutes, until lightly browned. 
        Cool on wire rack.</li>
    <li>Beat cream cheese, 1 3/4 cups sugar, 3 tablespoons flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon peel and 
        1 1/2 teaspoons orange peel in large mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 
        10 minutes. Split a 1 inch piece of vanilla bean and scrape seeds into cream cheese mixture. 
        Beat in 5 eggs and 2 egg yolks, 1 at a time, on medium speed. Stir in cream.</li>
    <li>Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Roll out reserved pastry trimmings 
        on lightly floured board; cut into strips 2 inches wide. Pat strips up side of pan, pressing 
        dough lightly to baked crust. Pour filling into crust. Bake 15 minutes. </li>
    <li>Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). DO NOT OPEN OVEN DOOR! Bake until 
        cheesecake is firm in center, about 50 minutes. Turn off oven; leave cheesecake in oven with 
        door slightly open for 1 hour. Remove from oven, and cool completely on wire rack. Refrigerate 
        at least 2 hours.</li>
</ol>
